## ENBF Attempt

This is an attempt at generating a MySQL parser in any language.

What we have so far:

* [MySQL grammar in ANTLR g4 format](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-workbench/blob/8.0/library/parsers/grammars/MySQLParser.g4) (thanks to MySQL workbench)
* [MySQL grammar in EBNF notation](https://github.com/adamziel/parser-generator-explorations/blob/71194eb0b1ac78fe3905b42662f19cdeac4adf42/ebnf/MySQLParser.ebnf#L14) thanks to the [grammar-converter](https://github.com/vorpal-research/grammar-converter/tree/master) tool.
* [A PHP parser](https://github.com/WordPress/sqlite-database-integration/pull/153) generated by AI based on the grammar. It works to an extent, but needs a few weeks of work before it's perfect.
* [An AI-converted PEG.js grammar](https://github.com/adamziel/parser-generator-explorations/blob/71194eb0b1ac78fe3905b42662f19cdeac4adf42/pegjs/join-lexer-and-parser/). Unfortunately, [the PEG.js parser exploration failed](https://github.com/adamziel/parser-generator-explorations/blob/71194eb0b1ac78fe3905b42662f19cdeac4adf42/pegjs/join-lexer-and-parser/README.md#L2).
* [A failed Jison exploration](https://github.com/adamziel/parser-generator-explorations/blob/7f08b9d563cfb3c04d7b5b743904ac6be4e99196/jison/) – Jison doesn't output an AST, only a flat list.
* [A failed Canopy](https://github.com/adamziel/parser-generator-explorations/blob/7f08b9d563cfb3c04d7b5b743904ac6be4e99196/canopy/) exploration – the final parser is large, slow, and seems to be outputting multiple alternative branches instead of doing a lookahead and choosing the right one.
* [An abandoned Ohm exploration](https://github.com/adamziel/parser-generator-explorations/blob/7f08b9d563cfb3c04d7b5b743904ac6be4e99196/ohm-js/README.md#L11) – Ohn seems promising, but there's no clear way of generating a static parser and the grammar conversion is quite laborous.
* [A failed Pegen exploration](https://github.com/TheLartians/PEGParser) – Pegen failed to parse the MySQL grammar due to a recursion error.
* [A C PEG exploration in progress](https://github.com/adamziel/parser-generator-explorations/blob/7f08b9d563cfb3c04d7b5b743904ac6be4e99196/peg/) 

Next steps:

* Find a parser generator with great debugging tools.   
   * Racket and [Racketscript](https://github.com/racketscript/racketscript) or [Whalesong](https://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/dyoo/whalesong.plt/1/8/planet-docs/manual/index.html)?
