## ENBF Attempt

This is an attempt at generating a MySQL parser in any language.

What we have so far:

* [MySQL grammar in ANTLR g4 format](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-workbench/blob/8.0/library/parsers/grammars/MySQLParser.g4) (thanks to MySQL workbench)
* [MySQL grammar in EBNF notation](https://github.com/adamziel/parser-generator-explorations/blob/71194eb0b1ac78fe3905b42662f19cdeac4adf42/ebnf/MySQLParser.ebnf#L14) thanks to the [grammar-converter](https://github.com/vorpal-research/grammar-converter/tree/master) tool.
* [A PHP parser](https://github.com/WordPress/sqlite-database-integration/pull/153) generated by AI based on the grammar. It works to an extent, but needs a few weeks of work before it's perfect.
* [An AI-converted PEG.js grammar](https://github.com/adamziel/parser-generator-explorations/blob/71194eb0b1ac78fe3905b42662f19cdeac4adf42/pegjs/join-lexer-and-parser/README.md#L1). Unfortunately, [the PEG.js parser exploration failed](https://github.com/adamziel/parser-generator-explorations/blob/71194eb0b1ac78fe3905b42662f19cdeac4adf42/pegjs/join-lexer-and-parser/README.md#L2).

Next steps:

* Find a parser generator with great debugging tools.
   * Ohm.js?
